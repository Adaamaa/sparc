    <h2>Research Area of Interest</h2>
    <p>The boll weevil, <i>Anthonomus grandis grandis</i> Boheman, 1843 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a historically significant pest of commercially cultivated upland cotton, 
        <i>Gossypium hirsutum</i> L. (Malvales: Malvaceae), that continues to impact cultivated cotton across the Americas. <i>Anthonomus grandis grandis</i> (abbr. Agg) is native 
        to Mexico and was first detected in the U.S. in Brownsville, TX, in 1892. The weevil quickly spread throughout the U.S. Cotton Belt, reaching the East Coast by 1916 
        (Burke et al., 1986). In 1978, the USDA launched the Boll Weevil Eradication Program—a concerted, multi-state program designed to unify the management approach and 
        eradicate the pest. 
        <br><br> 
        Two critical pillars of the program were (1) monitoring for Agg using pheromone-baited cone traps and (2) controlling the pest via the application of insecticides. 
        Today, control efforts in the U.S. remain reliant on pheromone-baited traps and the organophosphate insecticide malathion. However, emerging EPA standards will 
        likely restrict organophosphates due to ecological concerns, significantly complicating Agg management and eradication efforts. Moreover, monitoring efforts are complicated by 
        the fact that there are several sympatric, non-cotton pest weevil species that resemble Agg and are attracted to the Agg pheromone lure. These species include 
        <i>A. g. thurberiae</i> Pierce (abbr. <i>Agt</i>), <i>A. eugenii</i>, <i>A. texanus></i>, <i>A. hunteri</i>, <i>A. fulvus</i>, <i>A. cognatus</i>, <i>A. peninsularis</i>, 
        <i>Conotrachelus naso</i>, <i>Conotrachelus seniculus</i>, and <i>Curculio fulvus</i>. Of these, the most problematic is the Agg sister-taxon, <i>Agt</i>, which looks identical 
        to the untrained eye. Rapidly identifying Agg in the field and developing data pipelines for the design of Agg-specific pesticides are critical for long-term productivity 
        and sustainability of U.S. cotton. 
        <br><br> 
        Given rapid advancements in comparative genomics and AI methodologies, the next step is to develop tools that can give reliable results within minutes 
        and are nearly 100% accurate in distinguishing non-cotton pest weevils from Agg, and can be performed by anyone; ultimately eliminating latency between weevil capture and 
        identification. To complement the rapid AI-image detection based tool, we further propose to develop a lateral flow device (LFD), much like the “at-home” tests that became 
        widely used during the COVID-19 pandemic. LFD assays are broadly deployable in the field and require little to no expertise or training, and they can provide results in as 
        little as 15 minutes. The development of an LFD that can positively confirm Agg presence would be a boon to the eradication program and provide a tool that could be 
        distributed throughout the Cotton Belt with minimal need for training or equipment.</p>
