        <h2>Dr. Adama Tukuli</h2>
        <img src="images/adama.jpg">
        <p>Position: ARS SCINet/AI Center of Excellence Fellow (postdoc)</p>
        <p>Member Since: April, 2024</p>
        <p>Dr. Tukuli is Motivated AI expert.
            He possesses expertise in both life sciences and data science, making him a valuable asset to the weevil detection and 
            classification project. His extensive experience in AI model development is highlighted by his Ph.D. dissertation, where 
            he created a highly accurate AI classification model that distinguishes mutants from wild-type organisms with over 99% accuracy. 
            This work showcased his ability to manage complex classification tasks using a variety of AI techniques. Additionally, 
            Dr. Tukuli has contributed to projects involving advanced computer vision algorithms, which are displayed on his GitHub page. 
            His successful implementation of these models is directly relevant to the current project, where precise classification of 
            weevil species is essential. Dr. Tukuli's expertise in developing robust and reliable AI models will significantly enhance the project's 
            goal of creating effective tools for weevil identification and eradication programs. In his published papers, Dr. Tukuli has served as a 
            data analyst, handling large datasets from diverse organisms, including animals and plants. His broad experience with big data further 
            underscores his capability to contribute meaningfully to this project.

        <h2>Research Area Interest</h2>
        <p>Our team consists of highly motivated professionals dedicated to advancing molecular biology and AI research.
            The boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, 1843 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a historically 
            significant pest of commercially cultivated upland cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvales: Malvaceae) that 
            continues to impact cultivated cotton across the Americas. Anthonomus grandis grandis (abbr. Agg) is native 
            to Mexico and was first detected in the U.S. in Brownsville, TX, in 1892. The weevil quickly spread throughout the U.S. 
            Cotton Belt, reaching the East Coast by 1916 (Burke et al., 1986). In 1978, the USDA launched the 
            Boll Weevil Eradication Program - a concerted, multi-state program designed to unify the management 
            approach and eradicate the pest. Two critical pillars of the program were (1) monitoring for Agg using 
            pheromone-baited (10 mg grandlure; synthesized boll weevil pheromone) cone traps and (2) 
            controlling the pest via application of insecticides. Today, control efforts in the U.S. remain reliant on 
            pheromone-baited traps and the organophosphate insecticide malathion. However, emerging EPA standards will 
            likely restrict organophosphates due to ecological concerns, which would significantly complicate Agg 
            management and eradication efforts. Moreover, monitoring efforts are complicated by the fact that there are several sympatric, 
            non-cotton pest weevil species that resemble Agg and are attracted to the Agg pheromone lure. Therefore, rapidly 
            identifying Agg in the field as well as developing data pipelines that can be reliably used for the future design of 
            Agg-specific pesticides is imperative for the long-term productivity and sustainability of U.S. cotton. Given rapid advancements 
            in comparative genomics and AI methodologies, the next step is to develop tools that give reliable results within minutes, 
            are nearly 100% accurate in distinguishing non-cotton pest weevils from Agg, and can be performed by anyone; ultimately eliminating 
            latency between weevil capture and identification.
