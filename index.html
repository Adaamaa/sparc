            The boll weevil, Anthonomus grandis grandis Boheman, 1843 (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is a historically 
            significant pest of commercially cultivated upland cotton, Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvales: Malvaceae) that 
            continues to impact cultivated cotton across the Americas. Anthonomus grandis grandis (abbr. Agg) is native 
            to Mexico and was first detected in the U.S. in Brownsville, TX, in 1892. The weevil quickly spread throughout the U.S. 
            Cotton Belt, reaching the East Coast by 1916 (Burke et al., 1986). In 1978, the USDA launched the 
            Boll Weevil Eradication Program - a concerted, multi-state program designed to unify the management 
            approach and eradicate the pest. Two critical pillars of the program were (1) monitoring for Agg using 
            pheromone-baited (10 mg grandlure; synthesized boll weevil pheromone) cone traps and (2) 
            controlling the pest via application of insecticides. Today, control efforts in the U.S. remain reliant on 
            pheromone-baited traps and the organophosphate insecticide malathion. However, emerging EPA standards will 
            likely restrict organophosphates due to ecological concerns, which would significantly complicate Agg 
            management and eradication efforts. Moreover, monitoring efforts are complicated by the fact that there are several sympatric, 
            non-cotton pest weevil species that resemble Agg and are attracted to the Agg pheromone lure. Therefore, rapidly 
            identifying Agg in the field as well as developing data pipelines that can be reliably used for the future design of 
            Agg-specific pesticides is imperative for the long-term productivity and sustainability of U.S. cotton. Given rapid advancements 
            in comparative genomics and AI methodologies, the next step is to develop tools that give reliable results within minutes, 
            are nearly 100% accurate in distinguishing non-cotton pest weevils from Agg, and can be performed by anyone; ultimately eliminating 
            latency between weevil capture and identification.
